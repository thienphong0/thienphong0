## About Me

🌟 I'm Thiên Phong — a passionate learner from Vietnam.  
📚 I absolutely love studying **English** and exploring new languages!  
🎧 Always excited to improve my listening and speaking skills.  
💻 I enjoy technology, music, and dreaming big about the future.  

✨ Please be kind and understanding — I’m still very young and grew up with many difficulties. If I make mistakes, I sincerely hope you can help, guide, and forgive me, so I won’t repeat them. My only wish is to learn more knowledge and support my family. Please don’t be harsh or critical with me. 🥰
